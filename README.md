# MODNIKKY

My first experience in creating websites using a already made layout.

- <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/alAjoLLLRpNin6xTMJPYDD/Modnikky-__-Free-Fashion-Store-Template-by-Mingalyov-Mikhail?node-id=0%3A26">Original layout</a>
- I used there <a href="https://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/">parallax.js</a> library, which is poorly displayed on phones (blocking "backround: linear-gradient" css property)
- Do not judge strictly, since then much has happened to me
- You can also visit <a href="https://github.com/TarasKostiv/figma-proj">similar project from my friend</a>
